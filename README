To build, simply run `make clean` followed by `make build`. 

To do those two commands togethar, run `make clean-build`. 

To create a tar file, run `make tar` and it will be created at the top level directory.

Usage:
    ./412fe [flags] <filename>

Flags (Should be mutually exclusive; priority: -h > -r > -p > -s):

  -h
      Displays a help message describing all valid command-line options.
      
      If -h is present, the program ignores all other flags and arguments.

  -s <filename>
      This is simply Scanner mode. Reads the specified file and prints, to stdout, a list of all tokens found.
      
      Each token is shown with its line number, its syntactic category, and its lexeme (spelling).

  -p <filename>
      Parser mode. Reads the specified file, scans it, parses it, and builds the intermediate representation.
        • If the parse succeeds, prints:
            `Parse succeeded. Processed k operations.`
          where k is the number of operations handled.
        • If the parse finds errors, prints:
            `Parse found errors` with error messages written to stderr.

  -r <filename>
      IR mode. Reads the specified file, scans it, parses it, builds the intermediate representation, and prints the representation in a human-readable format to stdout.
      
      If parsing fails, error messages are written to stderr and the IR is not printed.

Default behavior:
    If no flag is specified, the program behaves as if -p <filename> was provided.
