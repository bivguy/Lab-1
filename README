To build, simply run `make clean` followed by `make build`. 

To do those two commands togethar, run `make clean-build`. 

To create a tar file, run `make tar` and it will be created at the top level directory.

Usage:
    ./schedule [flags] <filename>

Flags (Should be mutually exclusive; priority: -h > -r > -p > -s):

    -h
      Displays a help message describing all valid command-line options.
      
      If -h is present, the program ignores all other flags and arguments.

    -x <filename>
        scans and parse the input block. It should then perform renaming the code in the input block and print the results to the standard output stream.
    
    <filename>
        (No flag specified.)
        Runs the Lab 3 instruction scheduler on the input ILOC code and prints the scheduled output using the required multi-operation format.
